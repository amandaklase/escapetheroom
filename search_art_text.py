art_1 = "On the wall hangs an oil painting in an ornate gold frame. You move closer to admire the art. Well...admire is a strong word. More like you try not to recoil in horror as you examine the art."  
painting_1 = "The canvas is coated in inky black. From the depths of that diabolical sea, a shuddering horror arises, its montrous form hulking and cruel. Dashes of white spark in unexpected places...lights of hope? Or just a thousand merciless eyes watching you..."
painting_2 = "(You majored in art history. Just because you were a contestant on The Big House doesn't mean you can't have depth.)"
painting_3 = "The only thing to be found here is madness. You move on."
painting_4 = "You need to find something to block this camera before you escape."
painting_5 = 'You lean in closer to the painting and look at the artist name. "Henry Armitage". You make a note to remember that when you are interviewed on The View. The daring story of your escape will really pop with these kind of details.'
painting_6 = "You take the blanket off your shoulders and stand on tip-toes as you cover the painting, frame, camera and all. There. Take that, watching eyes."
painting_7 = "The painting is covered with a blanket. Better not disturb it."
painting_8 = "Hmm...do you have anything that might help?"
frame_1 = "The frame is gilded with ornate carvings of what looked like dancing figures from a distance and what looks to be depictions of murder scenes up close. Or maybe just tableaus from previous episodes of The Big House? Hard to say, but either way it's tacky."
frame_2 = "Just to the lower side of the frame, there is barely noticeable hump beneath the wallpaper."
frame_3 = "You feel the outlines of a thin rectangular shape. The wallpaper is too thick to tear. You'll need something sharper than your fingernails."
frame_4 = "Hmm...is there anything in your pocket that might help?"
frame_5 = "You use your makeshift glass knife on the wallpaper. A few quick slashes later, you have the keycard to the door in your hot little hand. That's right. Screw Mike Shapiro, and The Big House and Lord What's His Name. You're out of here."
frame_6 = "Just before you kick up your heels in glee, you notice a small dark spot on the top corner of the painting's frame. You look closer. It's a camera! You better find a way to cover this whole painting up before you leave."
frame_7 = "You've already got the keycard. Now you have to cover the camera!"
