end_table_1 = "You look at the small end table, which is fashioned in the same faux-baroque style of the rest of The Big House's furniture. On top is a vase with a flower."
vase_message_1 = "The vase doesn't hold just any flower. It's one of the black roses from the kiss-off bouquet that Dallas-Bailey Blake used to eliminate you and crush your dreams of a spin-off."
vase_message_2 = "You glare at it. Stupid rose. But just before you throw it to the floor and stomp on it, you notice a tiny rolled-up piece of dark red paper nestled among the petals."
vase_message_3 = "You stop looking at the rose and examine the vase. It's made of thin glass. Delicate glass. Breakable glass."
vase_message_4 = "You throw the vase against the wall, smashing it so hard the Hulk would be proud. The floor is littered in shards of broken glass. Fashioning a makeshift weapon never hurt anyone, right? You rip away a bit of your clothing and wrap it around the largest shard."
vase_message_5 = "You may be trapped but you're not a savage. You leave the vase alone."
paper_message_1 = 'You unfurl the scrap of paper and read "The door lock has two components. Be careful. Eyes are watching you. Eat this message after reading."' 
paper_message_2 = "You raise an eyebrow. 'Eat it?' Like, you're grateful for the PA's help but not paper-eating grateful. Maybe if she'd written something helpful like WHERE THE FREAKING KEYS ARE instead of creepy notes, you'd be hungrier. You put it back where you found it."
paper_message_3 = "You wouldn't touch that rose even if there was a crisp $100 bill nestled behind every petal."
search_vent_message = "You slide the table away from the wall and take a closer look at the vent. It's too small for a person but just the right size for a hiding spot. Too bad the front panel is bolted to the wall with four screws."
vent_message_2 = "You need to find something to get this panel off."
vent_message_3 = "Hmm...is there anything in your pocket that might help?"
vent_message_4 = "You use the screwdriver on the vent. When the front panel pops off, you reach inside and find an elaborate box. You pull it out, examining it box more closely. It's made of heavy brass and is small but deep, like a mass-market paperback of War and Peace." 
vent_message_5 = "A strange but somehow familiar crest of a creature, half octopus, half pissed-off badger is inset into the top. On the side, just under the push button to pop the lid is a code lock. Five spaces need to be filled, a brass slider operating each. You fiddle at them and see that you'll need a numeric cdoe to open it."
underneath_table_message = "You bend down and see that the table is half-blocking a vent."
box_message = "You'll try it later. You stick the box in your pocket for safekeeping."
